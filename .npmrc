# Allow build scripts for trusted packages
# @parcel/watcher and esbuild are safe build tools used by Next.js
# These are required for Next.js to function properly
enable-pre-post-scripts=true

# Note: If you still see warnings, run: pnpm approve-builds
# This will create a configuration file that explicitly allows these packages
